M109-Implication

Implications is a user interactive program written in three different languages:
Java, C and Python. 
They all have the same functionality of returning the correct mathematical
impliction given a statement. If the statement is not valid or there is no
input, an error message is given to the user. The program is case insensitive.
The user can exit the program by either typing "exit" or by ctrl D.
